we usually need to understand the performance of a model or even multiple models before using the test set.

Typically we canâ€™t decide on which final model to use with the test set before first assessing model performance. 
There is a gap between our need to measure performance reliably and the data splits (training and testing) we have available.

In this chapter, we describe an approach called resampling that can fill this gap. Resampling estimates of performance 
can generalize to new data in a similar way as estimates from a test set.
