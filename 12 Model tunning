This chapter introduced the process of tuning model hyperparameters that cannot be directly estimated from the data. 
Tuning such parameters can lead to overfitting, often by allowing a model to grow overly complex, 
so using resampled data sets together with appropriate metrics for evaluation is important. 
There are two general strategies for determining the right values, grid search and iterative search. 
In tidymodels, the tune() function is used to identify parameters for optimization, and functions from the dials package can extract and interact with tuning parameters objects.
